# sharepix-recklinghausen

A simple share pic generator for the local branch of the pirate party Recklinghausen.

## install

It's only HTML, JS and CSS, so it don't need any server side scripting. But the HTML5 
mechanisms used need an **https** connection. So upload the folder `generator` to any 
webserver and open it with a modern browser.

For development purposes you can start a **local webserver**. Install `node` and `npm` 
locally and then run `npm install` in the root folder. That will install a local 
https server. Then run the `server.sh` and open https://127.0.0.1:8080/generator/ in 
your browser.

## use

Open the project in your browser and start sharepixing. Just zoom out the browser
window, to see the whole sharepix.
